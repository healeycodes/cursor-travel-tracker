# cursor-travel-tracker

How far has my cursor travelled? Millions of pixels so far today.

![macOS menu bar: your cursor has travelled four million pixels](https://github.com/healeycodes/cursor-travel-tracker/blob/main/preview.png)

I know, because I wrote this small Python script that tells me in my macOS menu bar.

It's powered by [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) and [pynput](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Install

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Note: macOS may ask you to give your script increased permissions so it can track inputs!

```bash
python3 main.py
```
